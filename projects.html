                <h2>Junglebeauty</h2>
                <p>We recreated and revamped the website of Junglebeauty Bengal Cattery, making it more user-friendly and modern.</p>

                <i id="more-junglebeauty-button" class="fa-solid fa-chevron-down fa-2xl chevron-icon" onClick="toggleElement('more-junglebeauty', 'more-junglebeauty-button')"></i>

                    <p>
                        Our starting point was replicating the functionality and general aesthetic of the old PHP site. Prospective customers needed to be able to browse available kittens,
                        see pertinent information from the cattery owners, and have an easy way to contact the cattery. Our greatest improvement was the streamlining of kitten browsing;
                        the new gallery allows filtering by various characteristics while the kitten profiles allow for easy navigation to kittens' parents and siblings. The look and feel
                        of the site was updated significantly to create a more pleasant and user-friendly experience.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The website was developed using React, with the UI implemented using React Bootstrap. Data including cat profiles, cat pictures, and news items is loaded from Google's 
                        Firestore and Firebase services. A full list of libraries used can be found in the README in the project's GitHub repository.</p>

                        Olga Samolevska is an accomplished independent creator, and we are working with her to create an easily navigable and visually striking
                        website to house her works, which are currently divided across several platforms. The outline of the site is complete, and we are currently
                        gathering and adding content in preparation for its launch.

                        What started as a small assignment has grown into a game project that we continue to tinker with and add to. This card matching game
                        uses art and music from various movies by Studio Ghibli, which are loved by our developers. Our goal with this project is simply to
                        create a simple game that's soothing to play, with a secondary aim of providing players with a highly customizable experience.

                <p>A tool created alongside the Junglebeauty website, allowing the owners to control the data and content of the site.</p>

                        This React application connects to the Firestore database and Firebase cloud storage used by the Junglebeauty website. The app provides
                        an interface for viewing and manipulating data which is then served on the site. At present, the owners may add new cats (both parents and kittens)
                        and update existing ones, including setting their photos. Similar functionality exists for writing and editing news items and articles.
                        Authentication, also provided by Firebase, ensures that only the verified owners may use this app.
